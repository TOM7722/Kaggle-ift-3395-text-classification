# Kaggle-ift-3395-text-classification

## Overview
This project was developed for the IFT3395 Text Classification Kaggle competition. We implemented various machine learning approaches to classify text documents based on word occurrence frequencies, achieving a top 5 ranking among bachelor's degree students.

## Models and Results
We experimented with three different approaches:
- Naive Bayes Classifier: 71.967% F1-score
- Random Forest: 72.9% F1-score
- Neural Network: 69.864% F1-score
